Javascript Tetris
=================
###### An HTML5 Tetris Game

![](https://github.com/yasinnaal/javascript-tetris/blob/master/tetris-game-draw.jpg)

Tetris is a pretty easy game to implement, just a simple html file with some inline css/javascript.

The only tricky part is dealing with rotation of the 7 tetrominoes.

You could try to do mathematical rotations at run time, but you will quickly discover that some of the pieces rotate around a central block (j, l, s, t and z), whilst others rotate around a point between blocks (i and o).
